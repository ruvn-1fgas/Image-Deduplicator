# Image Deduplicator

Image Deduplicator is a GUI application that helps you find and remove duplicate images from a directory. It uses a combination of image hashing and file comparison to identify duplicate images.

## Installation

To install Image Deduplicator, you need to have a C++ compiler and the GTK+ 4 library installed on your system. You can download the latest version of GTK+ 4 from the official website: https://www.gtk.org/download/.

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can compile the source code using batch script ```make.bat```

## Usage

To use Image Deduplicator, simply run the `Image_Deduplicator` executable. The GUI interface will appear, allowing you to select the directory you want to scan for duplicate images. Once you have selected the directory, click the "Scan" button to start the scan. Image Deduplicator will then output a list of duplicate images. 
You can then select the images you want to delete, click right click on the list and select "Delete Selected Images". The images will then be deleted from the directory.
